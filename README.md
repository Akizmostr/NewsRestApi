# News Rest API

This project is a web-service designed for a news management system.
It is organized around REST and therefore uses standard HTTP features (such as HTTP verbs and status codes), JSON payloads, readable URLs and error messages.
It also has hypermedia support (HATEOAS).

This web-service is not just news reading service: it has users management support. Unregistered visitors can only read news and comments, whereas registered users have much more opportunities: aproved journalists can post and delete their own news, readers can leave and edit comments, search news by title and so on. 
In order to support these features, the web-service is thoroughly secured.
