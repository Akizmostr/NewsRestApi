== Response codes
As the News API is a REST API, it returns appropriate
HTTP status codes. Here is a list of the status codes
that you can expect from the API:

=== Success
****
[horizontal]

200 - OK:: Everything worked as expected.
204 - No Content:: The request has been fulfilled but it does not need
to return a response body. This notably occurs when a resource has been deleted.

****

[[errors]]
=== Client errors
****
[horizontal]

400 - Bad Request::	The request was unacceptable, often due to missing
a required parameter.
403 - Forbidden:: The request could not be fulfilled because the client is unauthenticated,
or it does not have the permission to access the resource.
404 - Not Found:: The requested resource doesn't exist.
405 - Method Not Allowed:: The request method is not supported by that resource.
422 - Unprocessable Entity:: The request body is invalid.

=== Server  errors
