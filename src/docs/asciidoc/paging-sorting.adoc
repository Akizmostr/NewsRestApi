== Pagination and Sorting

=== Pagination
All top-level API resources have support for bulk fetches via "list" API methods.
For instance, you can list news and comments.
These list API methods share a common structure,
taking at least these two parameters: page and size.

By default, the size of the page is 10, and the first page is always returned.
In order to override this behaviour, you can add the page and size parameters in the query:
----
http://localhost:8080/news?size=20&page=2
----

Response body consists of 3 parts: _embedded (contains main content),
links, page.

NOTE:: if the page number is out of range, the response
wouldn't contain _embedded section

==== Links
Links section contains available links to other pages.

==== Page
Page section contains page information:

include::{snippets}/news-controller-integration-test/get-all-news-with-page-success/response-body-beneath-page.adoc[]

=== Sorting
By now, sorting only by date is available.
All list methods return most recent resources first (descending order).
If you want to change sorting order, provide "sort"
query parameter and sorting direction(asc or desc) divided by a comma.

http://localhost:8080/news?sort=date,asc
