=== Authentication
Many of News' API methods require the user to be signed in.
You can perform simple GET requests without authentication.
Only logged-in users can post, update, delete resources.
For user registration and authentication use <<users-api, Users API>>.

The News API uses JWT token for authentication.
You can get JWT token after logging in (see <<login-user, logging user>>).
In order to log in successfully the user must be registered (see <<register-user, registration>>).
